# To Gun or Not To Gun (Spiral Knights)

<br>

## <ins>***Shining Knights***</ins>
<br>
Spiral Knights is a massively-multiplayer dungeon-crawler created by Three Rings Design. The game revolves around the player, a Spiral Knight, after the main ship, the Skylark, is struck by a massive energy source from the planet Cradle they were observing. The player crashes into the planet and the story follows their journey as they regroup with their fellow Spiral Order members and journey through the depths of Cradle, looking for a power source to repair their ship and go back to their home planet, Isora. 

<br>

When venturing the depths under the surface of Cradle, known as the Clockworks (due to the many massive gears and clock-like design that changes levels in real time), you will face many different hostile critters and mechanical monstrosities. To combat these you will need weaponry, from which there are 3 types to choose from: swords, guns, and bombs. Of these 3 types, guns are the safest options as it is a no brainer that standing far away from the enemy and shooting consistently is the safest way to deal damage (bombs cannot be thrown). 

<br>

Gunners also have the most options to choose from, since there are a total of 33 different 5\* (star) handguns to choose from. There are also plenty of lower star handguns as well, but they aren't as strong when you go deeper into the Clockworks. That being said, not all 5* guns are worth crafting, and they certainly are not all equal in power. In any case, I will be ranking these different gun choices so you'll know which guns you should bother investing in and which ones you can safely ignore. Do note that although there will be a Top 5 choice, a lot of other guns in lower rankings can be just as fun or even just as effective depending on the situation.

## <ins>***#33: Neutralizer***</ins>

Forget what I said about the lower ranking guns being just as fun or effective for a moment. This gun is hot garbage. The Neutralizer, and Catalyzer-line weapons as a whole, are a little dumb. The way they work is that they fire "charges" that start orbiting an enemy they come into contact with. After placing a few charges, you can launch a charged attack (hold left click) at the enemy that has those charges orbiting them. The charged attack will deal a mediocre amount of damage, but also detonate the charges orbiting an enemy and any orbiting nearby enemies, leading to a large amount of explosive damage. 

<br>

The problem is that why would you shoot an enemy a few times and then hit a charge shot, when you can just kill the enemy outright with a few shots from a different gun? Not to mention that there are 4 different types of damage in Spiral Knights, 3 of which that enemies are either weak to, strong against, or neutral to (Elemental/Piercing/Shadow) depending on the enemy. Then there is normal damage, which the Neutralizer deals. Normal damage has notoriously been underwhelming since its main gimmick is that it will always deal neutral damage no matter what enemy you are fighting against. 

<br>

When fighting an enemy that is resistant to your weapon's damage type, you will deal pitiful damage. Normal damage seeks to mitigate that by allowing your weapon to deal an okay amount of damage no matter what enemy you face. The issue is that you can equip two weapons at a time (4 with weapon slot upgrades), and Spiral Knights is a game where the level names and icons tell you what enemies will be in it and you can change your gear at the beginning of levels as well. All of this makes the Neutralizer one of the worst 5\* weapons in the game.

These guns are, incredibly underwhelming. The Tortofists specialize in close range gunning where you lunge forward and fire bullets right in enemies faces. The thing is that the damage simply sucks for what it is asking you to do. They aren't as good as swords (especially Brandishes) and lack the range and clip size to function as a decent mid ranged gun (2 shots per clip). I will go out on a limb and say that they deal more damage than I expected them too, but they still required maximum heat level and damage buffs in order to reach normal respectable damage levels. 

<br>

The Tortofists fall short in that they are good at almost nothing. They don't have the ability to deal with groups. Their single target damage is lacking and requires hard-focusing an enemy in order to make the damage work. And their charged attack which fires a bunch of crystals down from the sky onto the ground shortly in front of you deals medium damage, and thats only if enemies are caught directly by a crystal or are pushed into it, since enemies tend to walk around the crystals anyways. Though you can stunlock Trojans, I guess. Nah not that game-changing.

## <ins>***#28: Biohazard***</ins>

The Biohazard is similar to the Neutralizer in that it is a Catalyzer-line weapon. It deals Shadow damage and functions similarly to the Neutralizer, however it can inflict Moderate Poison. I personally believe that the poison does not redeem the weapon and make it any better that the 28th spot, but it does have the advantage that if you are poisoned, you can focus on placing charges, and detonate the charges when your poison wears off, so you deal maximum damage. 

## <ins>***#27: Sentenza***</ins>

The Sentenza is honestly a bit of an interesting case. It is a Shadow damage weapon from the Antigua line that has a fast projectile and deals a medium low amount of damage and fires 6 shots in a clip instead of the usual 2-3 in most guns. Now, Antigua hitboxes suck. The bullets are very jank and tend to do wacky things more often than not, such as phasing through blocks or even somehow not destroying a block that is right infront of them. Not to mention that Antiguas in general simply aren't all that viable. 

<br>

The main feature of Antiguas is that you can fire 6 shots before having to reload the weapon. However, most players will learn weapon-switching if they want to get better at the game. Weapon-switching is simply far more useful than having 6 bullets. The most basic idea of weapon-switiching is to swap weapons and then swap back before you fire the last bullet in your clip.

<br>

Blasters have 3 shots, so you fire 2, swap to your other weapon, then swap back. This completely resets the bullet count, so you can fire 2 bullets as if you have 3 shots in the clip instead of 1, plus you can weapon swap indefinitely. The benefits of being able to fire 6 shots is completely worthless when you can keep firing the same two bullets that deal more damage each than 2 Sentenza bullets.

The Argent Peacemaker is in a similar boat to the Sentenza, being an Elemental damage Antigua, thus most of what was said about the Sentenza applies to the Argent Peacemaker. I ranked the Peacemaker higher simply because I believe Elemental damage has more uses late game due to the amount of Construct and Undead levels you may encounter.
