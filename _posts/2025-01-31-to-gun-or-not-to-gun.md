## <ins>***Shining Knights***</ins>
<br>
Spiral Knights is a massively-multiplayer dungeon-crawler created by Three Rings Design. The game revolves around the player, a Spiral Knight, after the main ship, the Skylark, is struck by a massive energy source from the planet Cradle they were observing. The player crashes into the planet and the story follows their journey as they regroup with their fellow Spiral Order members and journey through the depths of Cradle, looking for a power source to repair their ship and go back to their home planet, Isora. 

<br>

When venturing the depths under the surface of Cradle, known as the Clockworks (due to the many massive gears and clock-like design that changes levels in real time), you will face many different hostile critters and mechanical monstrosities. To combat these you will need weaponry, from which there are 3 types to choose from: swords, guns, and bombs. Of these 3 types, guns are the safest options as it is a no brainer that standing far away from the enemy and shooting consistently is the safest way to deal damage (bombs cannot be thrown). 

<br>

Gunners also have the most options to choose from, since there are a total of 33 different 5\* (star) handguns to choose from. There are also plenty of lower star handguns as well, but they aren't as strong when you go deeper into the Clockworks. That being said, not all 5* guns are worth crafting, and they certainly are not all equal in power. In any case, I will be ranking these different gun choices so you'll know which guns you should bother investing in and which ones you can safely ignore. Do note that although there will be a Top 5 choice, a lot of other guns in lower rankings can be just as fun or even just as effective depending on the situation. 

<br>

## <ins>***#33: Neutralizer***</ins>
<img src="/images/Neutralizer.png">

Forget what I said about the lower ranking guns being just as fun or effective for a moment. This gun is hot garbage. The Neutralizer, and Catalyzer-line weapons as a whole, are a little dumb. The way they work is that they fire "charges" that start orbiting an enemy they come into contact with. After placing a few charges, you can launch a charged attack (hold left click) at the enemy that has those charges orbiting them. The charged attack will deal a mediocre amount of damage, but also detonate the charges orbiting an enemy and any orbiting nearby enemies, leading to a large amount of explosive damage. 

<br>

The problem is that why would you shoot an enemy a few times and then hit a charge shot, when you can just kill the enemy outright with a few shots from a different gun? Not to mention that there are 4 different types of damage in Spiral Knights, 3 of which that enemies are either weak to, strong against, or neutral to (Elemental/Piercing/Shadow) depending on the enemy. Then there is normal damage, which the Neutralizer deals. Normal damage has notoriously been underwhelming since its main gimmick is that it will always deal neutral damage no matter what enemy you are fighting against. 

<br>

When fighting an enemy that is resistant to your weapon's damage type, you will deal pitiful damage. Normal damage seeks to mitigate that by allowing your weapon to deal an okay amount of damage no matter what enemy you face. The issue is that you can equip two weapons at a time (4 with weapon slot upgrades), and Spiral Knights is a game where the level names and icons tell you what enemies will be in it and you can change your gear at the beginning of levels as well. All of this makes the Neutralizer one of the worst 5\* weapons in the game. 

<br>

## <ins>***#32-29: Grand Tortofist, Savage Tortofist, Omega Tortofist, Gorgofist***</ins>
<img src="/images/Grand_Tortofist.png">
<img src="/images/Savage_Tortofist.png">
<img src="/images/Omega_Tortofist.png">
<img src="/images/Gorgofist.png">

These guns are, incredibly underwhelming. The Tortofists specialize in close range gunning where you lunge forward and fire bullets right in enemies faces. The thing is that the damage simply sucks for what it is asking you to do. They aren't as good as swords (especially Brandishes) and lack the range and clip size to function as a decent mid ranged gun (2 shots per clip). I will go out on a limb and say that they deal more damage than I expected them too, but they still required maximum heat level and damage buffs in order to reach normal respectable damage levels. 

<br>

The Tortofists fall short in that they are good at almost nothing. They don't have the ability to deal with groups. Their single target damage is lacking and requires hard-focusing an enemy in order to make the damage work. And their charged attack which fires a bunch of crystals down from the sky onto the ground shortly in front of you deals mediocre damage, and thats only if enemies are caught directly by a crystal or are pushed into it, since enemies tend to walk around the crystals anyways. Though you can stunlock Trojans, I guess. Nah not that game-changing.

<br>

## <ins>***#28: Biohazard***</ins>
<img src="/images/Biohazard.png">

The Biohazard is similar to the Neutralizer in that it is a Catalyzer-line weapon. It deals Shadow damage (automatically making it better than its Normal damage cousin) and functions similarly to the Neutralizer, however it can inflict Moderate Poison. I personally believe that the poison does not redeem the weapon and make it any better that the 28th spot, but it does have the advantage that if you are poisoned, you can focus on placing charges, and detonate the charges when your poison wears off, so you deal maximum damage. 

## <ins>***#27: Sentenza***</ins>
<img src="/images/Sentenza.png">

The Sentenza is one of the 5* weapons you can craft from the 4* Blackhawk and it's honestly a bit of an interesting case. It is a Shadow damage weapon from the Antigua line that has a fast projectile, deals a medium low amount of damage, and fires 6 shots in a clip instead of the usual 2-3 in most guns. Now, Antigua hitboxes suck. The bullets are very jank and tend to do wacky things more often than not, such as phasing through blocks or even somehow not destroying a block that is right infront of them. Not to mention that Antiguas in general simply aren't all that viable. This isn't even considering that the Sentenza has a damage bonus versus Gremlins, further reducing its damage output against non-Gremlin enemies. 

<br>

The main feature of Antiguas is that you can fire 6 shots before having to reload the weapon. However, most players will learn weapon-switching if they want to get better at the game. Weapon-switching is simply far more useful than having 6 bullets. The most basic idea of weapon-switiching is to swap weapons and then swap back before you fire the last bullet in your clip.

<br>

Blasters have 3 shots, so you fire 2, swap to your other weapon, then swap back. This completely resets the bullet count, so you can fire 2 bullets again as if you have 3 shots in the clip instead of 1, plus you can weapon swap indefinitely. The benefits of being able to fire 6 shots is completely worthless when you can keep firing the same two bullets that deal more damage each than 2 Sentenza bullets. 

<br>

The Sentenza's charged attack is also a little underwhelming. It locks you in place to fire 6 shots in one direction before firing a 7th, larger, piercing projectile. The movement restriction is risky and the final projectile itself is a little weak, but can wipe out certain groups of enemies somewhat consistently, especially if they are weak to Shadow damage. 

<br>

## <ins>***#26: Argent Peacemaker***</ins>
<img src="/images/Argent_Peacemaker.png">

The Argent Peacemaker is in a similar boat to the Sentenza, being an Elemental damage Antigua, thus most of what was said about the Sentenza applies to the Argent Peacemaker. I ranked the Peacemaker higher simply because I believe Elemental damage has more uses late game due to the amount of Construct and Undead levels you may encounter. Not to mention that the charged attack hits quite hard against the Argent Peacemaker's targets, even doing more damage than the Sentenza charged shot against Slimes and Gremlins. 

<br>

## <ins>***#25: Obsidian Carbine***</ins>
<img src="/images/Obsidian_Carbine.png">

The Obsidian Carbine is the other 5* weapon you can craft from the Blackhawk (Sentenza/Obsidian Carbine). It's... okay? Unlike the other Antiguas, it has the ability to inflict Poison with its charge attack, making it much better as dealing less damage from a status is negligent when the damage was very low to begin with. Being one of the few guns to inflict a status effect, it is pretty handy as a sidearm, but the damage will never be great unless you are using charge shots. 

<br>

## <ins>***#24: Volcanic Pepperbox***</ins>
<img src="/images/Volcanic_Pepperbox.png">

The Volcanic Pepperbox is kind of a sad sight. Now don't get me wrong, it is an Autogun. To put simply, Autoguns are insane. They have ridiculous single target damage in exchange for locking you in place everytime you fire your gun. However, when you consider weapon-switching, shield cancelling, and Attack Speed Increase buffs, the movement lock barely becomes a problem, all without sacrificing the insane damage potential, which is why the Volcanic Pepperbox ranks as high as it does. 

<br>

That being said, the Volcanic Pepperbox does have some glaring weaknesses. For one, it deals Normal damage, meaning that no matter what kind of enemy you face, your damage never has the potential to exceed the standard. It also fires the original 2* Autogun's projectile instead of the piercing projectile the other 5* Autoguns fire, which means you are losing out on both speed, and the ability to hit multiple enemies at once at very close ranges. It also inflicts fire, which isn't bad by itself, but it lowers the Volcanic Pepperbox's pitiful Normal damage even lower. Easily the weakest Autogun. 

<br>

## <ins>***#23: Supernova***</ins>
<img src="/images/Supernova.png">

Pulsars as a whole are pretty versatile in what they do, they can knock enemies away, deal AOE damage, and deal decent damage as well. However, that versitility falls off fast when you have other weapons in your inventory. The Supernova deals Normal damage, though it doesn't have a status effect to lower its damage further, unlike the Volcanic Pepperbox. The bullets fired deal mediocre damage until a certain range, where the bullets then expand to deal maximum explosive damage and knockback enemies. 

<br>

Pulsars really are only good if you ONLY use guns. If you are using any other weapon type or gun along with a Pulsar, unless the other gun is worse than a Pulsar, you are better off changing your loadout to play around the other weapon you brought. Also the charged attack isn't worth mentioning since it is a bigger pellet that explodes into 4 normal pellets on contact. 

<br>

## <ins>***#22: Valiance***</ins>
<img src="/images/Valiance.png">

Valiance is the definition of versatile, unlike Pulsars. It deals a good amount of damage for a Normal damage weapon, and the projectile is both fast and deals consistent, but not excessive, knockback. Really you could slot this weapon into almost any loadout and it would still work just fine. However, the fact that it deals Normal damage means that the damage output will never be great. The charged attack is a large projectile that deals a good amount of damage. The charged attack isn't too isn't all that powerful, though it can stagger enemies pretty consistently. All in all, the Valiance is good, but never great, though because of that veratility, its lower star versions will carry you through most of the early-mid game. 

<br>

## <ins>***#21-19: Polaris, Permafroster, Wildfire***</ins>
<img src="/images/Polaris.png">
<img src="/images/Permafroster.png">
<img src="/images/Wildfire.png">

The other three Pulsars. The flaw of Pulsars is that they are extremely versatile. Let me explain. Their ability to do many things is great, but it means that they are not great at each individual thing. To put simply, there are guns for each of the thing Pulsars can do, but better. The versatility of these weapons simply aren't all that helpful. 

<br>

With that in mind, the Polaris and Permafroster are both in the same boat as their status effects, Shock and Freeze, respectively, stop enemy movement, allowing you to hit them with a barrage of attacks while they are stopped. But only if the status procs. It tends to be very inconsistent, but Permafroster ranks slightly higher as it deals Shadow damage instead of Elemental like the Polaris. Wildfire, however, inflicts Elemental damage as well as fire, which means it has the most damaging status effect, without any of the inconsistent and gimmicky knockback-stopping effects the Polaris and Permafroster have. 

<br>

## <ins>***#18: Owlite Wand***</ins>
<img src="/images/Owlite_Wand.png">

This thing is just goofy. It is an Alchemer that doesn't need to be reloaded, but with a slower fire rate. Alchemers only have 2 shots in their clips, but deal more damage to compensate. Plus, each shot will richochet up towards your left up to two times upon coming into contact with an enemy or surface. Weapon-switching is harder on Alchemers as you need to weapon-switch more often, being able to only fire one bullet before the next one triggers a reload. Charged shots will fire a large projectile that explodes into 4 smaller projectiles when reaching max distance or colliding with a surface or enemy. 

<br>

As for the Wand, it's okay, I guess. If you don't know how to weapon-switch, or if you find weapon-switching on Alchemers difficult, then this is a decent option. However, if you know how to weapon-switch, there is no point in using this. Oh yea, it deals Elemental damage by the way.

<br>

## <ins>***#17: Gilded Griffin***</ins>
<img src="/images/Gilded_Griffin.png">

Yes, yes, I know it's an Antigua. But in reality, this weapon is very capable. Because there are a few solid options for Piercing damage guns (even less for Piercing damage kiting guns), the ones that we do have, such as the Guilded Griffin, are really good. The Guilded Griffin fires really fast projectiles that are capable of hitting high mobile targets like Fiends and Beasts pretty easily. The other shortcomings of the Guilded Griffin are mainly attributed to the fact that it's an Antigua, but it still shines because of its niche damage and status as a kiting gun. 

<br>

## <ins>***#16-15: Storm Driver, Hail Driver***</ins>
<img src="/images/Storm_Driver.png">
<img src="/images/Hail_Driver.png">

I personally don't see much of a difference between the two, as both of them deal Elemental damage. Alchemers in general are harder to weapon-switch with and tend to do better against grouped up enemies. The same movement-freezing effects of the Polaris and Permafroster apply here. However, instead of messing up your shots by affecting the knockback of enemies, both Drivers deal little knockback, meaning if the freeze or shock procs, it just prevents enemies from attack momentarily without messing up your aim. 

<br>

## <ins>***#14: Plague Needle***</ins>
<img src="/images/Plague_Needle.png">

The Plague Needle is pretty strong. Like very strong. It deals Piercing damage and is essentially the Blitz Needle but with slightly lower damage due to being able to inflict strong Poison. Poison does three things: it lowers the target's attack power; it decreases the target's defense, meaning they will take more damage from all attacks; and it also prevents healing outright for the duration of the poison. 

<br>

Now the reason why the Plague Needle is so low is for a few factors. For starters, its obtainment is extremely hard. Normally, if I was ranking these guns objectively by how effective they are, Plague Needle would be higher, but it's hard to ignore how difficult getting the Krogmo Coins in the PVP mode is, all just to get the recipe to even craft the Plague Needle. Secondly, both of its abilities, high burst damage and the ability to inflict Poison, simply get outclassed by other weapons. When it comes to burst damage there is an objectively better option, and there are much better ways to inflict Poison outside of the Plague Needle. 

<br>

## <ins>***#13: Magma Driver***</ins>
<img src="/images/Magma_Driver.png">

I don't really have much to say about this weapon. It's an Elemental Alchemer with fire. But it is still good by all means. This weapon is typically better than the Storm and Hail Drivers since it has a stronger status effect, but is still overshadowed by the other Elemental Alchemer, thus it tends to get overlooked a lot. 

<br>

## <ins>***#12-11: Overcharged Mixmaster, Celestial Orbitgun***</ins>
<img src="/images/Overcharged_Mixmaster.png">
<img src="/images/Celestial_Orbitgun.png">

I want to clear something up right away: these guns are overpowered. If I was objectively ranking these weapons based on their effectiveness and abilities, these two are easily in the top 3 guns. The reason they are down here in ranking is because of their obtainment. These two weapons are limited in stock, only available during the Spring Equinox promotion event, which no longer seems to be held. When attempting to buy them from a vendor who happens to have one for sale, the prices are staggering, upwards of 10,000,000 crowns (currency) for the Orbitgun (for some reason, Mixmaster is often sold at DOUBLE the price of Orbitgun even though the two are almost functionally identical). 

<br>

But what makes them so strong? Both guns deal Elemental damage and launch 2 fireballs that spin around an invisible point as they travel outward (consider both fireballs together as a single projectile). When the projectile reaches its max distance, it stops and heads back to the player. Both fireballs explode when contacting an enemy or the player (no self damage). The charged attacks of both weapons fire two larger projectiles (think of each projectile as both normal fireballs) that also create a larger explosion when dealing damage. These weapons are incredible at shredding enemies and the fact that enemies with shields can't recognize the projectiles and shield against them. Too bad they are so hard to get. 

<br>

## <ins>***#10: Callahan***</ins>
<img src="/images/Callahan.png">

The Callahan is a Piercing damage weapon from the Magnus line and is one of the 5* weapons you can craft from the 4* Mega-Magnus. This weapon is pretty good against those that are weak against Piercing, however, the projectile is slow enough that Devilites and Wolvers (the most common enemies of the Fiend and Beast families, respectively) will typically dodge them. That being said, when you do manage to land a solid hit, either normal or charged, it usually obliterates enemies. Even against Tier 3 Wolvers on Elite difficulty, it just melts them instantly with a charged shot. Speaking of which, it fires a large projectile that pushes enemies along its path with an explosion at the end. Big boom. 

<br>

## <ins>***#9: Umbra Driver***</ins>
<img src="/images/Umbra_Driver.png">

This monster shreds slimes. The Umbra Driver deals Shadow damage with no status to lower its damage, and packs quite the punch against those unfortunate to get hit by it. There isn't much to say except have fun grouping slimes up and pummeling them with high damage, ricocheting bullets.

## <ins>***#8: Nova Driver***</ins>
<img src="/images/Nova_Driver.png">

The Nova Driver is the last Elemental damage Alchemer and it melts anything weak to Elemental if it even comes remotely near this gun. It also has no status effects like the Umbra Driver, unlike the other 3 Elemental Alchemers. This means it does max damage when hitting an Undead or Construct enemy, which also appear more often in later missions of the game. I am also ranking this gun higher than the Umbra Driver simply because I feel like Undead enemies such as Zombies and Constructs such as Scuttlebots are far easier to group up by manipulating enemy AI than slimes, making it far easier to take out groups. 

<br>

## <ins>***#7: Phantamos***</ins>
<img src="/images/Phantamos.png">

Similar to the Magma Driver, there isn't much to say about this weapon. If you need a powerful Shadow damage weapon, there are better options, and even when kiting the Umbra Driver's ability to ricochet shots is usually more potent than the Phantamos's shots. However, being a Blaster variant, it still deals incredible damage per shot, especially since it is a Shadow damage weapon. An all around, very good weapon. 

<br>

## <ins>***#6: Riftlocker***</ins>
<img src="/images/Riftlocker.png">

Similar to the Guilded Griffin, the fact that the Riftlocker is a Piercing damage kiting gun, it dominates the competition against other Piercing weapons. The advantage of the Riftlocker over the Guilded Griffin is the fact that its hitboxes aren't complete jank and can actually hit most of the targets you aim at. Plus, Blasters in general are great ranged weapons for hitting switches and allowing you to run through a level and ignore irrelevant enemies. 

<br>

## <ins>***#5: Arcana***</ins>
<img src="/images/Arcana.png">

The Arcana's ranking boils down to the fact that it is a Blaster variant and the fact that enemies weak to Elemental damage are simply in higher abundance in later stages of the game. That being said, the Arcana's amazing single target damage is what separates it from the likes of the Nova Driver, whose incredible damage really shines against groups of enemies, and does standard amounts of damage against single targets. 

<br>

## <ins>***#4: Grim Repeater***</ins>
<img src="/images/Grim_Repeater.png">

Shadow damage Autogun. All you really need to know is that this thing has the qualities of a superior 5* Autogun while dealing Shadow damage. Nothing else you need to know about this weapon. Well aside from the fact that the recipies for it are found in Clockwork Terminals so it is kinda hard to obtain. But when you get it, Slimes and Gremlins cease to exist. 

<br>

## <ins>***#3-2: Winter Grave, Iron Slug***</ins>
<img src="/images/Winter_Grave.png">
<img src="/images/Iron_Slug.png">

These two weapons are very similar in how they function. Their attacks are the same as the Callahan, as all of them are from the Magnus (Tundrus for Winter Grave) lines. The Iron Slug is the other 5* weapon you can craft from the 4* Mega-Magnus. The reason the Normal damage Iron Slug is so overpowered is because its charged attack deals a decent amount of damage on contact, but pushes enemies directly backwards depending on which way they are facing, meaning if an enemy or a group of enemies are directly facing you, you can make the charged shot push enemies along as it travels, as it does not explode until it reaches max distance or touches a surface. Therefore, the "decent" amount of damage is constantly applied, allowing a charged shot to essentially one shot most normal enemies in the game. 

<br>

The Winter Grave is similar to the Iron Slug, except it deals Shadow damage and trades some of its damage for the freeze effect. The reason why this is relevant is because it allows the Winter Grave to freeze enemies in place completely if the freeze procs. Then you can pummel them again and again until they die while they are completely helpless. The two are relatively interchangable, however, the Iron Slug can consistently deal high damage against all targets, even against the Winter Grave's targets, while the Winter Grave can freeze its targets to constantly damage them over and over again. 

<br>

## <ins>***#1: Blitz Needle***</ins>
<img src="/images/Blitz_Needle.png">

The Blitz Needle. The best gun in the game. It deals Piercing damage. It has no statuses. It deals NO knockback when shooting enemies. It absolutely SHREDS enemies within it's range so long as they are not resistant to it. It completely changed the meta of the game as the Blitz Needle made farming the strongest (and richest) boss in the game exceptionally easy. The Blitz Needle has the ability to unleash what is likely the strongest charged attack in the game. Nutty damage with the ability to damage groups if close enough because of its piercing projectile. Overall, no question about what belongs in the number one spot, especially considering this gun's ease of obtainment.
