# The Feels of Summer

<br>

### <ins>***Have you ever been wrong?***</ins>

I’ve been wrong before, about many things. Things that I am not ashamed of, and other things my pride simply won’t allow me to bend my knees to. But in all honesty, I think one of my most important mistakes was thinking that there was nothing special about summer. Summer was always just a free month off of school and work for me, nothing more, nothing less. 

<br>

However, until last year, I never understood the value of that time off, what could truly be done with that free time. I visited Canada and Buffalo last summer and connected with friends and family I hadn’t seen in years. This kind of gap in connection I find astonishing, however too many people experience these gaps in seeing family and friends and think nothing of it. And I'm here to change your minds.

### <ins>***The Story***</ins>

I woke up the Wednesday before the last Friday of summer. My mom was shaking me awake to get ready for the 8 hour trip. It was 5 in the morning, on a Wednesday. You know, I got ready, we got in the car with our heap of stuff and set off, not too much of a problem.

Now, after we passed the Holland Tunnel (I live in Brooklyn), which took about an hour alone because of traffic. It was pretty much just an open road. There were farms, fields, stadiums, everywhere. The car ride was pretty chill, I was helping my dad with navigation while the rest of my family was playing games in the back of the car. 

The ride was long, since traffic slowed us down, but eventually, we reached the border of Canada and the United States of America. After the passport and other talk, we headed into Canada, arriving at my cousin’s house not too long after. 

I hadn’t seen my elder cousin in about a year, but he was so much more different than I had imagined him. He was taller, skinnier in a way. He had sunken eyes, from the negotiations to enter Canada I presume. We hit it off immediately. It was nice to have someone I could connect to since there weren’t many people like that where I live in Brooklyn. It hit me that aside from my friends, who else have I got to connect with besides family?

We stayed in Canada for a few days while touring Ontario. Canada was much different than the bustling city I was accustomed to. There were hardly any buildings above 4 stories, unlike the towering skyscrapers of downtown Brooklyn and Manhattan. A lot of farms in the rural areas and few people on the sidewalks, but certainly a lot of French. 

After visiting my cousin in Canada, my family headed back for the USA. In a few hours, we arrived in Buffalo, where another cousin and a friend of mine stayed. Again, I haven’t had someone to connect with in so long, that I was ecstatic when we got there. We played long rounds of football (or soccer, pick your choice), Uno, online games, it was amazing. I wished I could stay forever since I had not had such fun in so long. 

I even went to my cousin’s soccer practice and helped his team out with their practice sessions. I hit it off with a few people and to be honest, I felt sort of jealous that outside of professional soccer teams, there weren’t many casual soccer clubs around my area in Brooklyn. The people you meet and memories you make truly do last a lifetime.

Unfortunately, all good things have to end and me and my family headed back to Brooklyn. However, I took with me an understanding that people, no matter how bad they may seem, are still necessary. You can’t live without other people involved in your life.

### <ins>***In Conclusion***</ins>

Having someone you can relate with and connect to is incredibly important. Your family, they will be with you forever, friends come and go. Boyfriends/girlfriends come and go. But family, real family, is there for you forever. So, if this story was of any interest to you, give a call to a relative you haven’t seen in a while. Ask them how they are and plan to meet up. You will thank yourself for it.
