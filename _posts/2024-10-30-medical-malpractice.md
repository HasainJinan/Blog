# Medical (Mal)Practice (Team Fortress 2)

<br>

### *(Forgive the random topic, I no longer wish to go poking around with python modules and make a long blog about that.)*

<hr>

Ahh, yes. Team Fortress 2. You've heard about it, no exceptions. For a game as old as it is (17 YEARS AT TIME OF WRITING THIS??), it sure is holding up very well against the test of time. Sure, it's experienced its fair share of neglect from VALVe and has been overrun by bots at one point. But recently the game has been steadily recouping and its dedicated fanbase is as ecstatic as ever. 

<br>

But aside from the game's history, if you have never played the game before, you might be wondering, what is it about? Team Fortress 2 is a class-based (or hero-based as they call it now days) first person shooter that revolves around 2 teams, Reliable Excavation Demolition (RED) and Builders League United (BLU), as they fight each other over land in New Mexico (goofy idea, I know). 

<br>

However the game has a lot more depth than that, with each mercenary having fully fleshed out backgrounds, personalities, and stories. Each merc is easily distinguishable by their silhouette alone and their behavior is another key factor in what makes them such likeable characters. 

<br>

The character I'm going to be talking about is the Medic. Easily the most important class in any organized and even unorganized games of TF2. The Medic is German, mad-doctor stereotype and is the quintissential healer class of TF2. Utilizing his secondary weapon, the Medigun, he can connect a beam of healing salve (don't ask what is in it) to his teammates to heal them of their injuries at a relatively fast pace. 

<br>

## <ins>***Playing Medic***</ins>

If you are willing to give the Medic a shot, just understand that you will die a lot when starting out. You will die horribly, but thats all part of the learning process. Your main goals as a medic will be to build Ubercharge, keep as many teammates alive and healthy as possibly without sacrificing your safety, and above all else, stay alive and away from the enemy as much as possible. Normally, class-based first-person shooters are teamwork dependant, which is the case in Team Fortress 2 most of the time, but not for the Medic. ***As the Medic, your life matters more than that of your teammates***. 

<br>

It doesn't matter if your Demoman player is burning to a crisp out on the field. If he is in the middle of a fight with the entirety of the enemy team and you don't have the rest of your team to back both of you up, do not put yourself in critical danger in order to help him. Get outta there. A good thing to remember is that Medic will match the speed of heal targets that are faster than him, so if you see a friendly Scout nearby who is also retreating, attach beam to him, and use the boost in speed to get out. Make sure you also stay close to your Scout buddy to keep the heal beam attached until you get to a safe enough location to recoup.

<br>

The next important thing is to build that sweet, sweet Ubercharge. The Medic's secondary weapons, the mediguns, while incapable of damaging opponents, are really his primaries, as they are the tools that the Medic will use roughly 90-95% of the time (usually less if you have the Crusader's Crossbow primary equipped) in order to heal his teammates. Additionally, while healing teammates, you will also fill a bar on your screen that reads **"UBERCHARGE,"** which is important. You can build Uber optimally by prioritizing hurt or not fully overhealed teammates. Healing teammates over 142.5% HP (almost fully overhealed) will half your Uber build rate, so it is recommended to spread out your heals and heal as many of your teammates as possible to build as fast as possible. 

<br>

Getting the bar to 100% and right clicking with your medigun held out will activate 8 seconds *(or 4 charges of 2.5 seconds for the Vaccinator)* of Ubercharge for you and your patient. The Ubercharge granted depends on the respective medigun you are using. These Ubercharges range from granting tripled healing rate, to 75% damage resistance *(Vaccinator)*, to triple damage, or even complete invulnerability. A good teammate can do a lot with 8 seconds of Ubercharge. However, remember that all Ubercharge percentage you build is lost on death, which further exacerbates your main goal of staying alive. Even if you were at a low Ubercharge percentage when you die, the 10 or 20 seconds you spend in the respawn queue is 10 to 20 seconds you are not actively building Ubercharge and healing injured teammates. 

<br>

The third most important job as a Medic is to keep as many of your patients alive and as healthy as possible. This part of the Medic gameplay loop is the least important of the big 3 goals since staying alive and building that Uber is too important to give up for some measly healing and overheal. Overheal is a mechanic where after you heal a patient to full health, continuing to heal them will fill their health to a maximum of 150% of their normal max health. When the beam is disconnected, the overheal will decay at a rate dependent on the health of the class. All classes, whether its a 450 HP overhealed Heavy or a 185 HP overhealed Scout, will decay back to their respective maximum health in exactly 15 seconds, assuming they take no external damage. 

<br>

To quickly summarize your goals as a Medic, your job is to keep as many of your teammates alive and healthy as possible without putting yourself in danger, all while building Ubercharge in order to organize team pushes to give your team an advantage. 

<br>

## <ins>***Mediguns***</ins>

All mediguns heal at the base rate of 24HP/sec, except for the Quick Fix, which heals at an increased base rate of 34HP/sec. These healing rates are also the same when applying overheal, except for the Vaccinator, which applies overheal at a rate of 8HP/sec because of its overheal penalty. All mediguns except the Vaccinator have a single Ubercharge of 8 seconds, and the duration of the Uber shortens everytime you switch your healing target to another patient while the Uber is active. The Vaccinator instead holds 4 charges and using Uber will deplete 25% charge from your meter, giving you and your patient a 2.5 second bubble of resistance against a selected damage type. 

<br>

## <ins>***Stock: Ol' Reliable***</ins>

Stock is the default medigun that you start out with and it is, hands down, the strongest and most dependable of the 4 mediguns. Its Uber gives you and your heal patient 8 seconds of complete invulnerability to damage. 8 seconds where you and your patient cannot die to bullets, rockets, grenades, stickybomb traps, melee attacks, needles, or even backstabs. However, in exchange for this ridiculous power, it also takes the longest to charge *(technically its build rate is normal since it's stock)*. 

<br>

Even when building Uber optimally, it still takes 40 whole seconds of charging to get an Uber ready, and in reality, you won't be building Uber optimally the whole time you are alive, so in practice it takes about 1 minute or more for the average Medic to build a stock Uber after respawning. However, the reward of having the strongest Uber in the game is no joke. And there is a reason the other mediguns have faster Uber build rates to compensate.

<br>

So how should you play with the stock medigun? Since this Uber is the most powerful and takes the longest to charge, you should be the most risk-averse when playing with stock, only playing more aggressively and closer to the frontline when you are close to hitting 100%. As for actually activating Ubers (this applies to all single charge mediguns), you should use the Uber when a ***sufficient*** opportunity presents itself. 

<br>

Try not to hold onto a full Uber for entire minutes after reaching 100%. Waiting for a perfect opportunity where the enemy is confused and outnumbered, your team is right by your side, everyone on your team is fully overhealed and ready to push, the enemy sentry is/sentries are down, and a few teammates are wrecking havoc on the enemy backline, is a fool's errand. Such an opportunity will not present itself even once a match, most times not once, even in a few matches. Always look for the next best option, and take advantage of that.

<br>

On the other hand, you shouldn't be popping Uber as soon as you get to 100%. You will waste quite a few Ubers that way. Just have a little more patience when deciding when to pop Ubers and lower your standards for popping Ubers overall. But never be indecisive. Being unsure of a decision will lead to absolutely nothing being done. If you are being attacked by a bombing soldier, who is jumping in to specifically target you, pop the Uber. At least then you won't end up in the respawn queue and you may be able to do something with you waning Uber, rather than dropping it outright. Remember that all Uber is lost on death, so using it to save your life is a valid choice. 

<br>

As for heal patients, who is a good stock Uber patient? Truth be told, there is never really a *"bad uber."* Because of the nature of the stock Ubercharge and the invulnerability it grants, any Uber pop should put some space between you and your opponents as they will be wary of the fact that they cannot damage you while your patient can. That doesn't mean you should pop on any teammate and be done with it. Barring player skill, there are some generalities and stereotypes that occur when deciding who to Uber, such as Spy usually being a bad uber recipient, and Demomen/Soldiers being really good. 

<br>

However, even if certain classes are better Uber recipients, you should still be taking notes in your mind about which players are better that which and who is better at what class. This will help you make informed decisions on multiple things, such as who is better to rely on in order to retreat, who can hit shots in the most unlikely of situations, who can demolish the enemy team with a single Ubercharge. It also helps you decide on who you shouldn't rely on: who can't hit the broad side of a barn and cover your rear for you to escape. 

<br>

The general order of bad recipients to good recipients looks something like this (actual placements vary from situation to situation):

<img src="/blog/images/UberRecipientList.png" width = 100%>

<br>

Although there will be exceptions that crop up often, the general rule of thumb is to Uber those putting out damage on the frontlines. Because of how the Spy class is structured and how it functions, Spy is, more often then not, a bad stock Uber recipient. Engineers and Snipers tend to stay towards the back so they are less threatening when Ubered, though if you have a Battle Engineer subclass doing good damage on the frontlines, they will never be a bad option. Same case goes for a good Huntsman Sniper, a pretty good Uber recipient in those scenarios. 

<br>

Fellow Medics will be your number one heal priority. Make sure to keep your friendly Medic(s) alive. As an Uber patient, however, ehh not so great. Medic's horrible offensive and even defensive capabilities means that unless you are Ubering a Medic for the funsies, most of the time, they are going to get nothing done. However, if your fellow Medic is close to getting 100% Uber, and you two are the only ones left alive on your team, it may beneficial to Uber your fellow Medic to help them get out of there alive, regroup with your team, and push in with their Ubercharge, however, such a situation rarely crops up since you should be able to spot when a fight is going South and get out of there if you think your Ubercharge will not make a difference. 

<br>

Scouts aren't the best with an Uber due to their single target nature, however, if you have a good Scout, never overlook them. A good Scout is TERRIFYING if they can run at the enemy and pump them with 100 damage shots without having to worry about death. Pyro and Heavy is kind of in the same boat, as both deal their best damage at close ranges, but are worse at a distance. While Heavy has more DPS at closer ranges, he is simply too slow to catch up to enemies most of the time, enemies who will most likely be running away after seeing an invincible, Ubered Russian man. As for Pyro, people will also run away from seeing the Ubercharge, however, Pyro is only capable of good damage at Flamethrower range, outside of that and the Flare Guns simply aren't helpful enough at dealing damage in order to secure a few kills. 

<br>

Though, Ubering a Pyro who is aware of their ability to airblast can help in stuffing an enemy Ubercharge by preventing the Uber patient from doing anything. Just make sure you check your patient's ammo count before deciding on who and when to pop. 

<br>

Soldiers are great Uber recipients and they belong in their own tier below Demomen simply because they hold less explosives and most Soldiers run Gunboats or some Banner instead of the shotgun, thus they lack a lot of raw damage output. Never a bad recipient though. 

<br>

It is no surprise that the class that can hold up to 16 explosives with both his primary and secondary weapons combined is exellent at clearing enemies while invulnerable. It is the best class for punching through sentry nests and the AOE capabilities makes him absolutely devestating against an unprepared team. His solid 175 health points also means that as you continuously heal him during Uber, he will come out of the Ubercharge with a good 260 health as well, more than a Soldier. 

<br>

Do note that these are all best choices based on class alone, but player skill matters immensely when determining who will do the most with your Ubercharge. It should be noted that not only should you keep track of good players on the enemy team, you should also be taking notes on your own teammates: who can destroy a few sentries when you need them too, who can take out a few enemy players or save you when you are backpedaling after losing a team fight, who can't hit the broad side of a barn and, by extension, fail to save your life.

<br>

## <ins>***Kritzkrieg: Your Uncle's Gambling Addiction***</ins>

The Kritzkrieg is the definition of high risk/high reward in Team Fortress 2. The stats read as follows:
- Ubercharge grants 100% critical chance
    - \+ 25% Ubercharge rate

<br>

Yea that's it. Seems kind of mundane since its only different stat is the increase in Uber build rate. However, its Uber is completely different than that of Stock's. In exchange for invulnerability, the Kritzkrieg gives you and your patient 8 seconds of guaranteed critical hits. For those of you unaware of crits in TF2, critical hits take triple the base damage of a weapon and ignore damage fall off. A Soldier rocket that would normally do around 40 damage at quite a distance will always deal 270 (90 * 3) damage at any range, to anyone even remotely caught in the explosion. It doesn't take more than 2 braincells to understand why that much damage is busted: Big Boom = Dead Enemies.

<br>

However, this amazing damage is also this Medigun's downfall. The Kritzkrieg is the least defensive of the 4 Mediguns as it offers absolutely no defense when you pop the Uber. You are no safer popping an Uber than not popping if your teammate cannot defend you, even with triple damage. 

<br>

The Ubercharge Recipient tier list does look very similar to Stock's though, for more or less the same reasons, however, Heavy's would have a higher priority than Pyro's due to speed no longer being an issue. You see, since crits ignore damage fall off, a 9 damage minigun bullet will always deal 27 damage, which quickly adds up with the miniguns rapid rate of fire. Heavy's can melt any target that isn't across the map with this insane DPS (damage per second). 

<br>

One of the Kritzkrieg's sort of "passive drawbacks" is that it encourages a more active playstyle. The Kritzkrieg charges faster, therefore less time sitting towards the back of your enemy composition safely building Uber and a higher chance of dying. When popping Uber, you need to be fairly close to the frontline in order to keep your beam on your heal target so they do not lose crits, all while receiving no defense boosts from your Ubercharge, making you prone to dying. 

<br>

So what is the gambling part of this Medigun? Most Medic players dislike the Kritzkrieg due to the lack of defense it provides to both you and your patient. But for those who try it once, it's almost like taking drugs (this is the most valid analogy I can give you, I swear). Everytime you pop Ubercharge on a patient, there is the likely chance that absolutely nothing happens. No spectacular play, or your patient or even you end up dying. But there is also that off chance that trusting your teammate with the Uber was the right call and trust me, there is no sweeter sound than hearing the ***ding*** of the kill sound effect over and over again and watching the killfeed turn white with just your name as assists. Nothing more satisfying that watching the overhead display put 6 new skull icons underneath 6 unfortunate souls on the enemy team. 

<br>

## <ins>***Quick Fix: Underrated or Underpowered?***</ins>

The Quick Fix is, quite a hot topic amongst Medic players. Before going into the nitty gritty, here is the stat text:
- Ubercharge increases healing to 300% and grants immunity to movement-impairing effects
    - \+ 40% heal rate
    - \+ 10% Ubercharge rate
    - \- 50% max overheal
- Mirror the blast jumps and shield charges of patients

<br>

The Quick Fix heals faster than the other Mediguns, simple as that. Instead of the base 24 hp/second of the other Mediguns, it heals at a rate of 34 hp/second. On top of the faster heal rate, it also builds Ubercharge 10% faster than the Stock Medigun. While on paper, that 10% doesn't sound a whole lot faster, however, the Medic has a hidden passive where his Ubercharge build rate is cut in half when healing a patient above 142.5% hp. Meaning keeping your beam attached on a fully overhealed target will cause you to build half as fast as long as that patient stays fully overhealed.

<br>

That's where the Quick Fix's downside comes in. As punishment for healing faster (and building Uber faster I guess), you can only overheal patients up to 125% their max hp, unlike every other Medigun which can overheal to 150% max hp. This means two things. On one hand, because your teammates hp never goes above 142.5% hp, you will always be building at max Ubercharge build rate, regardless of the status of your patient. So as long as you are healing someone at any given time, you will always have an Ubercharge ready every 40 or so seconds. 

<br>

On the other hand, it poses a huge detriment to your team's overall fighting ability. Overheal is busted, to put simply. Never sleep on the ability to give your teammates a boost in their hp past their normal max limit. However, the Quick Fix only allows you to overheal up to 125%, which gives enemy players overhealed normally an advantage in team fights, simply because they will have more health overall and you as a Medic cannot heal everyone at once, therefore your faster heal rate will not make up for your lack of overheal most of the time. 

<br>

Oh, but it gets worse. Remember how I said overheal will always decay at a rate that will bring a class's hp from 150% to 100% in 15 seconds, irrespective of the class? That decay rate still applies even if you are running the Quick Fix. So not only are your overheals half as strong, they also only last 7.5 seconds, or half as long, further crippling your ability to overheal. All in exchange for this godforsaken Ubercharge. 

<br>

So what is this Ubercharge? The Quick Fix grants the patient (and the Medic) with 300% healing for 8 seconds. I mean yea sure, I heal faster by default for 40 seconds and I'm rewarded with even faster healing, yippee. In all seriousness though, the faster healing is quite handy, but not for the reason you might expect. Unlike Stock Ubercharge, which is used for preventing damage most of the time, the Quick Fix is used to quickly patch up weak teammates and get them back into the fight faster with a weakened overheal (or a "quick fix"). 

<br>

The Ubercharge is not meant to be used as a means of pushing sentry nests or go on killing sprees as it does not have the defensive nor offensive capabilites to be able to do either. It's meant to be used as a way to quickly patch up your teammates and help them get back faster after they sustain a bunch of damage. 

<br>

As for the Uber's other ability, preventing all movement-impairing effects. All it really means is that it makes you immune to knockback and slow. Which may be great if you want to push an area without getting stuffed by a Pyro and their airblast, however, the Quick Fix isn't Stock, and often times your patient ends up dying to explosives or other fire because they don't take any knockback to get pushed out of a situation. They just stand there and die. 

<br>

But it does have its moments. When your teammate isn't actively dying, the fact that they cannot be stopped as they walk forward and destroy the enemy team is quite great. Also, swapping away from your Medigun will cancel the movement-impairing effects, allowing you to surf bullets and rockets once again. Also the ability to mirror shield charges and blast jumps rarely has uses aside from rolling out from spawn faster, but it does have some moments as well where you can coordinate a blast jump to get you and a teammate out of a bad situation.

<br>

## <ins>***Vaccinator: Ruining People's Days and Your Social Skills***</ins>

Oh the Vaccinator, seriously where do I even begin with this weapon. It is notorious amongst the community for being absolutely stupid, both to use and to fight against. As usual, the stat card: 
- UberCharge provides a 2.5 second resistance bubble that blocks 75% base damage and 100% crit damage of the selected type to the Medic and patient
    - \+ 67% Ubercharge rate
    - \- 66% Overheal build rate
    - \- 33% Ubercharge rate on overhealed patients
- Press your reload key to cycle through resist types
- While healing, provides you and your target with a constant 10% resistance to the selected damage type

<br>

Okay, okay, that's a lot of text. Functionally, the Vaccinator is the most complex of the 4 mediguns. To break it down, the Vaccinator passively applies a 10% resistance against your selected damage type. By default it's bullet resistance, but by pressing your reload key (r by default) you will cycle between bullet, blast, and fire resistance. The resistance also only applies when you are actively healing a patient. This passive resistance also does not provide crit resistance, just damage resistance to normal bullet/blast/fire damage. 

<br>

Now the Ubercharge is where this Medigun really differs from the rest. Instead of one whole 8 second Ubercharge, your meter is divided into 4 separate charges, each of which last 2.5 seconds. Your Ubercharge as a whole builds a whopping 67% faster than Stock at the cost of building 33% slower when healing overhealed patients, not even counting the halved building rate when healing fully overhealed patients. 

<br>

Popping Ubercharge will place a shield, or bubble as they are commonly called, on you and your patient. This bubble will shield you and your patient from 75% of damage from the damage type you selected when popping the Uber. It will also guarantee complete crit immunity to the damage type you selected.

<br>

Bubbles remain on your patient even after you switch away to another weapon, unlike other Mediguns where the Ubercharge fades after breaking beam connection, allowing you to pop multiple bubbles on multiple teammates, albiet for a short period of time. The Ubercharge really excels in keeping teammates alive, since 75% damage resistance is no joke, and its sheer disposability makes it much harder to waste an Uber than with the other 3 Ubercharges. 

<br>

The ability to almost always have an Uber ready and reactively pop to counter a certain damage type your teammate may be facing is an easy way to screw over many people in the game. You have little to no hope in taking on a Vaccinator Medic alone. You need to focus fire them with teammates or use melee weapons, an already risky solution. Dying as a Vax Medic is also less of a detriment to your team since unlike the other Mediguns, regaining an Ubercharge is extremely quick and easy, all on a Medigun that makes it harder to die. 

<br>

## <ins>***Conclusion***</ins>

Medic is one of those classes that is usually really easy to understand, but incredibly difficult to master. This blog post/guide really only covers the basics of Medic and how to play him, this is by no means a way to instantly get better at the game. Speaking of which, I myself am not perfect at the way I play the game, I could certainly be better so don't take what I say here to heart. 

<br>

But use your critical thinking skills to analyze and digest what I have shown you, to understand what this all means and what you interpret from it all. Use that interpretation to make your own sound judgement when you are out there, saving your teammates from death and kiling enemy gamers. 

<br>

What I mean to say is...

Get good. Come on now, all great gamers in history, your favorite League of Legends streamer, B4nny, whoever you look up to in gaming, they didn't get to where they are by reading an article and just playing the game once or twice. They put hard work, training, hours, even tears into the game to get better at it. The best piece of advise I can give in this entire post will be to practice. So get in there and get your hands dirty, and when you are ready, "let's go practice medicine."
